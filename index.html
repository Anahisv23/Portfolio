      <p>Hi there, my name is Anahis and I am a Software Engineer based in Orange County California. I am a volunteer Full Stack Software Engineer contributing to an open source project from Hack for LA that involves maintaining the website, attending stand-ups, and collaborating with other developers and tech leads.
        <br></br>
        Before I started my software engineer journey, I was a college student majoring in psychology. My interest in Software Engineering, began my last year when I took two computer science classes in which I got to build projects using HTML and CSS. Shortly after graduating college, I then completed JavaScript courses on FreeCodeCamp and then later enrolled myself in a four month coding boot camp where I gained a solid foundation in JavaScript, Postgres, Express, React and Node after building 4 Full Stack web applications.
        <br></br>
        I also have a background in psychology that allows me to be very thoughtful in creating intuitive web applications. I am also very passionate about building projects that will facilitate processes for people and help them reach their goals.
        <br></br>
        When I‚Äôm not volunteering I like to work on my personal projects to hone my development skills. And when I am not coding altogether I enjoy yoga, gardening, and watching reality tv.

            <p class="gray-box">
              Scrap Cook is an innovative web application aimed at promoting sustainable eating habits by guiding users to creatively utilize leftover ingredients through carefully curated recipes. Harnessing the power of React and CSS, I meticulously designed a sleek and user-friendly interface, prioritizing clean aesthetics and intuitive navigation. The integration of React Router ensures seamless movement throughout the application, maintaining up-to-date URLs for enhanced usability.
              
              Incorporating the Edamam API into the frontend enriches the user experience by offering a diverse range of recipe options to explore and enjoy. Behind the scenes, I employed a robust tech stack including React, React Hooks, React Router, Local Storage, CSS, and HTML to not only encourage sustainable eating practices but also empower users with insights into their food consumption habits and environmental impact.</p>

            <p class="gray-box">Plant Place is a frontend catalog where you can browse and buy plants. I got to dive into this project as part of a React challenge, one of three I've tackled so far. These challenges were all about building specific features to meet the project's needs.

              For Plant Place, I used React to build the whole user interface. I also played around with CSS to make it look tranquil and minimal, giving users a zen-like browsing experience. 
              
              My main goal here was to sharpen my React and CSS skills. I used React Router to help users navigate smoothly through the app and keep the URL up to date. Plus, I added React Paginate to make the user experience smooth. 
              
              Behind the scenes, I used tech like React, React Hooks, React Router, React Paginate, Local Storage, CSS, and HTML to make Plant Place a pleasant spot for plant lovers.üå±üõí </p>

I built manibest to empower users by including affirmations for self-love and self-compassion. Manibest also includes affirmations that developers and bootcamp graduates can use to combat imposter syndrome and manifest career success. I developed various vertical slices to render different categories of affirmations, add or delete affirmation sets, and to save user favorite affirmation. Users can heart an affirmation and save it to my favorites, can practice a variety of affirmations, and can make their very own affirmations.

In addition, I also incorporated the node mailer module in the backend to allow users to invite external users to join trippn. Lastly, I developed code to gatekeep and protect backend routes to allow only authorized users to perform certain crud operations. </p>

In the backend Grace Monger used Node, Express, and Sequelize. React and Redux were used in the front end. I developed various vertical slices to render products and single product. I also wrote code to add, edit, and delete products to change store inventory. Lastly, I worked on the logged in user crud operations such as add to cart and edit quantity of products.</p>

I used Javascript, Sequelize, Express, React-redux, HTML and CSS to build a Student and Campus managment system. This is a fullstack Javascript application that allows users to view campuses and students enrolled at those campuses. In addition, you can also add new campuses and new students. I learned alot from this project because it was my first fullstack application and I feel more confident in my Software Engineering abilities! I am excited to build more projects and learn many new technolgies in the future! </p>
